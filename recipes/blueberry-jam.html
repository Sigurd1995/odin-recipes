        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Blueberry jam is a great condiment and fits perfectly with pancakes.</p>
            <p>Combine it with crispy bacon for a perfect balance of <em>sweet</em> and <em>salty</em>!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh Blueberries</li>
            <li>Granulated White Sugar</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Cardamom</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Blueberries – Wash the berries, pulling out any stems or bad berries. Pulse blueberries in a blender to roughly chop.</li>
            <li>Cook the Jam – Add berries, sugar, lemon juice, and cardamom to a wide, shallow pan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. As mixture boils down, it will foam up and reduce. Stir occasionally to ensure it’s not sticking. If it does stick, reduce the heat.</li>
            <li>Thicken the Jam – Once the foam begins to subside, start to stirring constantly. Jam will darken in color and take on a thick, syrupy consistency. It’s done when it coats the back of a spoon and you can draw a line down the center of the pan that takes a moment to refill.</li>
            <li>Cool the Jam – Allow the blueberry jam to cool 5 – 10 minutes in the pan, just enough to make it safe to handle. Transfer the hot jam to a clean glass jar or storage container. Cool the jam at room temperature for about 90 minutes before refrigerating. Chill 6 – 8 hours to allow it to set and thicken completely.</li>
        </ol>
